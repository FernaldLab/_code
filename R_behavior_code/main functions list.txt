.getDataBatch()
# Reads in all the data in a folder, and returns a list containing one list for each behavior scoring file.
# Each file's list contains:
#    1. $data, a data frame with columns behavior, start frame, (end frame), (duration)
#    2. $codes, a matrix with column 1 containing the codes, column 2 containing the meanings, and
#          column 3 containing the subjects.
# Can also use .getData(filename) to load a single file.
# Usage:
# filepath = "~/Directory/Folder/"
# data <- .getDataBatch(paste(folderPath, list.files(folderPath, pattern = 'txt$'), sep = '')
